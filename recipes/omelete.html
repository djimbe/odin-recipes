        <p>I call this simple omelet recipe "Italian" for a couple of reasons. First, I used olive oil instead of butter, and second, I cooked the eggs quickly in a hot pan, letting them get a little golden brown. The traditional French omelets are thicker and cooked much more gently.</p>

    <ul class="list">
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crumbled goat cheese, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped chives, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>sea salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1 class="sub-title steps">Steps</h1>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, swirling oil to coat the skillet. Pour beaten eggs into the hot skillet and cook in hot oil until eggs bubble and begin to firm up.</li>
        <li>Lift the cooked edges of omelet with a rubber spatula and tilt the skillet so any uncooked egg runs underneath the lifted edge. Continue cooking, lifting the edges and tilting the skillet, until omelet is almost completely set, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat. Spread any runny egg evenly over the top of omelet using the spatula.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle goat cheese, 1 1/2 teaspoons chives, sea salt, and black pepper over omelet. Gently lift one edge and fold 1/3 of the omelet into the center over cheese and chives. Fold the opposite 1/3 of the omelet into the center. Slide omelet to the edge of the skillet and flip, folded-side down, onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Top omelet with remaining 1/2 teaspoon chives to serve.</li>
    </ol>
